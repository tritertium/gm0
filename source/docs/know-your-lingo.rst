===============

Many teams may be unfamiliar with the various terms and slang that are often thrown around at competitions and meets. Here we have compiled a guide of some commonly used terms to get you up to speed.

Competition
------------

**Alliance**  
    Group of two teams that compete together in a match.

**Autonomous Period**  
    The first 30 seconds of a match where the robot operates without driver control, following pre-programmed instructions.

**Driver-Controlled Period (TeleOp)**  
    The portion of the match after Autonomous where drivers control the robot using gamepads.

**Elimination Match**  
    Two alliances of 2 or 3 teams each compete in a double-elimination playoff bracket to determine the winning alliance. Also called "elims" or "playoffs".

**Inspection**  
    Pre-match check to ensure the robot complies with game rules, size, and safety requirements.

**Judging**  
    Evaluation process during tournaments where teams present their engineering notebook, interview judges, and demonstrate outreach and design efforts.

**League Meet**  
    Match-only event within a league. Results contribute to a teamâ€™s league ranking. No judging occurs.

**League Tournament**  
    Final event of a league. Includes ranking matches, alliance selection, elimination rounds, and full judging. Teams can advance to State or Regional Championships. Also known as a League Championship.

**Program Delivery Partner (PDP)**  
    Organization or individuals responsible for coordinating FTC programs and events in a region. Official FIRST contact for teams in that area.

**Qualifier**  
    Official tournament where teams play at least 5 qualification matches and participate in a double-elimination playoff bracket. Judging is included, awards are given. Top-performing teams advance to the next level of competition (e.g. Regionals or States).

**Qualification Match**  
    Randomized matches where teams are paired with different alliance partners and opponents. Rankings are based on performance across each match.

**Ranking Points (RP)**  
    Primary metric for team rankings during qualification matches. Each team earns 2 Ranking Points for a win, 1 for a tie, and 0 for a loss (game-specific values may vary).

**TieBreaker Points (TBP)**  
    Used to break ties in team rankings.

Robot Components
----------------

**Arm**  
    Mechanism responsible for extending the reach of the robot using rotational or multi-axis motion.

**Claw**  
    Mechanism that grasps and holds game elements.

**DC Motor**  
    12VDC RS-550 motors used to power mechanisms, controlled in an open-loop. Maximum of 8 allowed per robot.

**Drivetrain (DT)**  
    Subsystem that provides movement to the robot.

**Gamepad Controller**  
    Xbox or PS4-style controllers used to drive the robot during the driver-controlled period. Up to 2 gamepads are allowed, connected via the Driver Station.

**Driver Station (DS)**  
    Android phone connected to gamepads. Used by the drive team to operate the robot and start/stop matches.

**Intake**  
    Mechanism that collects game elements from the field using rotational motion.

**Linear Extension / Slide**  
    Mechanism that moves linearly to extend a part of the robot beyond its starting configuration.

**REV Control Hub**  
    All-in-one device combining a control system (Android-based) with motor, servo, and sensor ports. Replaces the need for a separate Robot Controller phone. May be paired with one Expansion Hub.

**REV Expansion Hub**  
    Hardware control module that supports up to 4 motors, 6 servos, and multiple types of sensors. Maximum of 2 hubs allowed total (including Control Hub).

**Robot Controller**  
    Android phone connected to an Expansion Hub (if not using a Control Hub). Communicates with the Driver Station via Wi-Fi Direct.

**Servo**  
    Closed-Loop servo-motors controlled by PWM signals. Max of 12.
